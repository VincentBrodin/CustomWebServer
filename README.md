# Custom Web Server

This project is a deep dive into understanding how web servers operate.
It uses a built-in HTTP listener, but everything on top of that is custom-built to provide hands-on experience with server functionality.

### Features:
- **Static File Support**: Easily serve static content such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.
- **Custom Static Folder**: Set up a root folder for serving all your static assets.
- **Simple Routing**: Supports both GET and POST routing, making it easy to handle basic requests.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Includes the ability to manage dynamic paths for more flexible routing.
- **Template Rendering** You can render html templates with handlebars .Net
