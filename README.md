# Stratus Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Stratus**, an ultra-lightweight .NET backend framework designed for flexibility, performance, and ease of use.

Stratus provides a simple and customizable structure that allows developers to create their own routers and rendering engines through intuitive interfaces, rather than being forced to work within rigid structures. It’s built to give you full control over your application, ensuring you can design it exactly how you want.
