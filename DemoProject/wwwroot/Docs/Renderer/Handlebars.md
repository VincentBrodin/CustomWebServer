# Handlebars.NET

[Handlebars.NET](https://github.com/Handlebars-Net/Handlebars.Net) is a popular templating engine for .NET, based on the Handlebars.js library. It allows you to create dynamic HTML templates by embedding expressions and logic directly within HTML markup, which can then be rendered with data.

## Key Features:
- **Logic-less templates**: Handlebars allows embedding logic and expressions in templates, without introducing complex logic in the templates themselves.
- **Partials**: Reusable template components that can be included across multiple templates.
- **Helpers**: Extend Handlebars functionality with custom helpers for advanced operations like iteration, conditionals, etc.
- **Data Binding**: Templates can be rendered with any data model, making them ideal for dynamic content generation.
